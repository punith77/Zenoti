# API Features
    
    1. Generate Token - An API that takes username/password in the body and returns an
    access token in the response. Assume for now that if the username passed is kirang , an
    access token will be returned successfully, otherwise an error. The access token needs
    to be passed as a HTTP header in subsequent requests that require authorization.

    2. Save City Weather - This API takes the name of the city and corresponding weather data
    to save it in memory. The data is essentially a list of days and the mean temperature
    recorded on those days. If the city data already exists, it is updated.

    3. Fetch City Weather - This API takes in the name of the city and a date range to return
    the temperatures recorded for those dates. To be able to fetch city weather, you need to
    save the city weather first (done by calling Save API). You should be able to handle error
    cases such as when city data has not been saved or when dates requested are out of
    range or invalid, using Bad request error. City names are case insensitive.

    4. Delete City Weather - This API takes in the name of the city and deletes entire data
    corresponding to the city from memory. Fetching city weather after this operation results
    in a Bad request error. City names are case insensitive.
